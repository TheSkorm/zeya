INSTRUCTIONS

1. (Optional) Add the directory containing zeya.py to your PATH.

2. Install dependencies:

   Install the Ogg/Vorbis encoder and the decoders for one or more of the
   following: Ogg/Vorbis, FLAC, and MP3. On an Ubuntu system you can do this
   with:

    aptitude install vorbis-tools flac mpg321

   Python <=2.5 users will need to install the simplejson library:

    aptitude install python-simplejson

   If you're using the 'dir' (directory) backend, also install tagpy:

    aptitude install python-tagpy

3. Run zeya.py. The --help flag shows the available options. We support two
   backends:

   'rhythmbox' (default): read files from the current user's Rhythmbox library

     $ zeya.py

   'dir': read files from a directory and its subdirectories (recursively)

     $ zeya.py --path=/path/to/music


CLIENT SUPPORT

Zeya has been tested in the following browsers:

* Firefox 3.5.2

  All Firefox versions >= 3.5 should work. No issues are known.

* Chrome 3.0.198.1

  Zeya works, with a couple of caveats, described below.

  Known issues:

  Latency between when you click on a song and when it starts playing is very
  high.

    Chrome seems to require the Content-Length header to be set on audio data,
    so we have to finish encoding the entire file before we can send any data
    to the client. In addition, Chrome seems to request each audio file twice.

  Zeya does not advance to the next song when the current one has finished.

    This is due to chromium bug 16768 and is fixed in Chrome/chromium >=
    r23336. <http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16768>
